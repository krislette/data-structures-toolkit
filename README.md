# Source Code Configuration
If you want to test the source code and run the application on your own device, here are the following steps that you should follow.
1. Source Code Installation
   - Download all the files by clicking the `Code` button located above the repository.
3. Swing Layout Installation
   - To install Swing Layout, [click here](https://jar-download.com/?search_box=swing-layout-1.0.4). After downloading, right-click on the `Libraries` folder of the project in NetBeans IDE, and add the .jar      file to that folder.
4. Absolute Layout Installation
   - Since Absolute Layout is already a built-in dependency in Java, locate it in your NetBeans directory and include it in the project in the same manner as you added the Swing Layout.
5. Application Run
   - Once all required .jar files are downloaded and added to the `Libraries` folder, ensure you have installed all files in the repository, including .png, .java, .form, etc. Then, the app should function    
   properly. You can now run it in your NetBeans IDE.
